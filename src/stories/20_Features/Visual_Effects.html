    ## Ken Burns Effect
    Best known for his work on documentaries, Ken Burns developed a signature effect in his work which consisted of a combination of panning and zooming over an image. 
    We can achieve this simple yet popular and captivating effect by combining the 'pan' and 'zoom' animations in `amp-story`. Here's how to do it.

    The general idea is to nest elements to combine the animations: the container element will animate the zoom, and the image inside the container will be animated with a panning.
    * Start by creating a div which will act as the image container. Set its style class to set `position:absolute`.
    * Set its animation to be `animate-in="zoom-in"` or `animate-in="zoom-out"` and its duration with `"animate-in-duration=30s"`.
    > In this demo we use 30 seconds but your mileage may vary. Try experimenting with different values to see what works best for your desired results.
    * Inside this container, add an `<amp-img>` element with the `src` attribute pointing at your image, describe the size of the image with the `width` and `height` attributes of the `<amp-img>` element. Set `layout="fixed"` so that the image outsizes the screen real estate (We want to use a large image that can be panned over. We recommend 1024 x 768 px or larger).
    * Animate the `<amg-img>` element using the `animate-in="pan-right"`. (You can also use `pan-left`, `pan-up`, and `pan-down`. [See amp-story animations list.](/stories/features/animations/#zoom-in) 
    >  It's important that the **image** sets the **panning animation**, whereas the image **container** sets the **zoom animation**. Otherwise the dimensions of the image will change, causing undesired results in the animation.
    * You can also achieve the effect with multiple images! Just combine the animations as described in the [combining animations section](/stories/features/animations/#combining-animations). Just remember all the elements being animated after certain animation must include the `animate-in-after` attribute. Including the children being animated. See below for the code sample.
    Keep in mind results may vary depending on the image size and animations you use. Experiment with different animation durations and presets to see what you like best!
