  #### Introduction

  The `amp-carousel` component works great for image galleries. The carousel requires the `height` attribute to be specified in advance. This can be tricky if the displayed images and captions vary in size. Here are two approaches to solve this problem.

  <!-- Import the carousel component in the header. -->

  <!-- #### Dynamic Text Size -->
  <!--
    The first image gallery uses
    [amp-fit-text](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/extended/amp-fit-text.html) to fit the text to the available space. This works well if captions vary not too much in length.

  <amp-carousel class="carousel1" layout="responsive" height="450" width="500" type="slides">
    <div class="slide">
      <amp-img src="/img/Border_Collie.jpg" layout="responsive" width="500" height="300"></amp-img>
      <amp-fit-text layout="responsive" width="500" height="150"> The Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock, especially sheep. It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience.  Considered highly intelligent, and typically extremely energetic, acrobatic, smart and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in dog sports, in addition to their success in sheepdog trials. They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies also remain employed throughout the world in their traditional work of herding livestock.  </amp-fit-text>
