  #### Introduction

  AMP HTML is entirely built on existing web technologies. It achieves reliable
  performance by restricting some parts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

  To make up for those limitations AMP HTML defines a set of custom elements
  for rich content beyond basic HTML.

  To set everything up, AMP HTML requires a some boilerplate:
-->
<!-- -->
<!doctype html>
<!-- This tells everyone that this is an AMP file. `<html amp>` works too. -->
<html ⚡>
<!-- #### Head -->
<!-- -->
<head>
  <!-- The charset definition must be the first child of the head tag. -->
  <meta charset="utf-8">

  <!--
    AMP HTML files require a canonical link pointing to the regular HTML. If no HTML version
    exists, it should point to itself.
  -->
  <link rel="canonical" href="Hello_World.html">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1">
  <style>body {opacity: 0}</style><noscript><style>body {opacity: 1}</style></noscript>
  <!-- The AMP runtime must be loaded from the last element in the head. -->
  <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
</head>
<!-- #### Body -->
<!-- -->
<body>
  <!--
    Most HTML tags can be used directly in AMP HTML.
  -->
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <!--
    Certain tags, such as the `<img>` tag, are replaced
    with equivalent or slightly enhanced custom AMP HTML tags (see
    [HTML Tags in the specification](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/spec/amp-html-format.md)).

    You can use the [ AMP Validator ](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/guides/validate.html) to check
    if your AMP HTML file is valid AMP HTML. Simply
    add `#development=1` to an AMP URL. Validation errors will be printed in the Javascript console.
    You can try it with this website which is build with AMP.
