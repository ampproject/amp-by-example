  ## Introduction

  An introduction into how to create [AMP Ads](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-a4a/amp-a4a-format.md). AMP Ads are ads implemented using AMPHTML. The AMP Ad runtime is based on the AMP runtime and provides the same performance benefits. However, there are a few things that make them different from normal AMPHTML files.
