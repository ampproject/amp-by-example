  <!-- Import the carousel component in the header. -->
  <script async custom-element="amp-carousel" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-carousel-0.1.js"></script>
  <!-- We will also be using the amp-fit-text component, but this is not required. -->

  <!-- #### Basic Usage -->
  <!-- Display a list of images as slides. -->
  <amp-carousel width="400" height="350" layout="responsive" type="slides">
    <amp-img src="img/image1.jpg" width="400" height="300" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
    <amp-img src="img/image2.jpg" width="400" height="300" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
    <amp-img src="img/image3.jpg" width="400" height="300" layout="responsive"></amp-img>
  </amp-carousel>

  <!-- #### Supported Contents  -->
  <!-- Each of these nodes may also have arbitrary HTML children.  -->
  <amp-carousel width="400" height="300" layout="responsive" type="slides">
    <div>
      <div class="blue-box"></div>
      This is a blue box.
    </div>
    <div>
      <div class="red-box"></div>
      This is a red box.
    </div>
    <div>
      <div class="green-box"></div>
      This is a green box.
    </div>
  </amp-carousel>

  <!-- #### Advanced Carousels-->
  <!--
    The height of an `amp-carousel` needs to specified in advance. This can be tricky if the
    displayed images and captions vary in size. Here are two examples for advanced carousels.

    The first carousel makes use of
    [amp-fit-text](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/extended/amp-fit-text.html), which
    works very well with `amp-carousel`.
  -->
  <amp-carousel class="carousel1" layout="responsive" height="450" width="500" type="slides">
    <div class="slide">
      <amp-img src="img/Border_Collie.jpg" layout="responsive" width="500" height="300"></amp-img>
      <amp-fit-text layout="responsive" width="500" height="150">
The Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region
for herding livestock, especially sheep. It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience.
Considered highly intelligent, and typically extremely energetic, acrobatic, smart and athletic,
they frequently compete with great success in dog sports, in addition to their success in sheepdog
trials. They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies also
remain employed throughout the world in their traditional work of herding livestock.
      </amp-fit-text>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <amp-img src="img/Shetland_Sheepdog.jpg" layout="responsive" width="500" height="340"></amp-img>
      <amp-fit-text layout="responsive" width="500" height="110">
The Shetland Sheepdog, often known as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog. Less favored nicknames
are the Toy Collie and the Miniature Collie. They are small dogs, and come in a variety of colors,
such as sable, tri-color, and blue merle. They are very intelligent, vocal, excitable, energetic
dogs who are always willing to please and work hard.
      </amp-fit-text>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <amp-img src="img/Hovawart.jpg" layout="responsive" width="500" height="350"></amp-img>
      <amp-fit-text layout="responsive" width="500" height="100">
The Hovawart is a medium to large size German dog breed. The name of the breed means "an estate
guard dog", which is the original use for the breed. The breed originated in the Black Forest
region and was first described in text and paintings in medieval times.
      </amp-fit-text>
    </div>
  </amp-carousel>

  <!-- Another carousel with caption, this time the caption overlays the image. -->
  <amp-carousel class="carousel2" layout="responsive" height="400" width="500" type="slides">
    <div class="slide">
      <amp-img src="img/Border_Collie.jpg" layout="fill"></amp-img>
      <div class="caption">
