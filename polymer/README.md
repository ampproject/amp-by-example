# AMP by Example in Polymer

This sample demonstrates how to embed AMP pages inside a Polymer app. You can see the sample in action by visiting [https://www.ampbyexample.com/polymer](https://www.ampbyexample.com/polymer)

## Installation

1. To build the polymer app, run the following command from the repository root:

  ```none
  $ gulp build:polymer
  ```

2. If everything went well, `gulp backend:watch` should now be running the site on <http://localhost:8080/polymer>
