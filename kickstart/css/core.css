/**
 * Horizontal scrolling interferes with embedded scenarios and predominantly
 * the result of the non-responsive design.
 *
 * Notice that it's critical that `overflow-x: hidden` is only set on `html`
 * and not `body`. Otherwise, adding `overflow-x: hidden` forces `overflow-y`
 * to be computed to `auto` on both the `body` and `html` elements so they both
 * potentially get a scrolling box. See #3108 for more details.
